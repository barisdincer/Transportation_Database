# Transportation_Database
 
## Problem Definition
 In our modern world, people use a lot of vehicles for different purposes like transformation, logistic etc. The automotive sector started with the invention of steam engine in 19 centuries, vehicles became an important part of human life. First vehicles used steam power and after that the gasoline used for energy in internal combustion engines. There were 250.000 cars in 1907 and with the invention of Ford Model T this number increased 500.000 in 1914.  After the World War 2, the automotive sector became one of the most important sectors and today’s world there are 1.440 billion cars in the world that are used actively. 96% percentage of these car use fossil fuels. The fossil fuels have some effects on environment like CO2 emissions (Volti, 2006).
 With the combustion of carbon and respiration of living creatures, CO2 formed. Emissions means that release this gas into atmosphere in specific area and period. CO2 also known as greenhouse gases. Burning the fossil fuels is the most important cause of CO2 emissions.

According to the Our World in Data, CO2 emissions rate is increasing day by day. In the 1950, nearly 6 billion tons of CO2 were emitted and these number increased 22 billion tons in 1990 and now this number over the 35 billion tons each year. The increase of this graph has been slowed in few years but still number of emissions is too high. (Friedlingstein, 2010)
## Purpose of Project
We saw the fossil fuels cause the CO2 emissions and these emissions affect environment. Most of today’s car release CO2 to atmosphere and increase the emissions rate but there are some alternatives to reduce CO2 emissions. These alternatives are electric vehicles. The idea of developing electric vehicle is not an easy one. The cost of electric car’s engine and the early performance of this car’s engine made lost people interest. Gasoline engine was cheaper and more useful. Because of these reasons electric car idea was not popular than in our modern age. With the development of battery technology, electric vehicles technology has been developed too. The cost of electric vehicles has decreased and performance of these car increase day by day. Electric vehicles use energy stored in battery or fuel cell units. These options reduce the emissions from the transport sector. In our modern age, countries and governments encourage to use this technology. In the future, green electric vehicles will be more popular. Green vehicles use renewable energies, and this technology is so important for our world. This project aims to show alternative vehicles that are not cause CO2 emissions and create a dataset for helping people to choose right vehicles for their budget. In the graph below, we see the electric sales by countries and world in 10 years. This graph also shows us, electric vehicles becoming more popular day by day.

Not only electric car important for CO2 emissions, also renting app for electric scooter, public transportation is significant factor for decreasing emissions and greenhouse. There are many applications that customers can found electric cars, scooters, bicycles. Customer can rent these vehicles and pay hourly. It is suitable for every budget and these vehicles don’t bad effects on environment. Public transportation is also important vehicle for decreasing emissions. If people use transportation for daily task rather than personal car it will be a positive effect on environment. Also, many countries use electrical public transportation anymore. 

## Method
First of all, we decided together that our project should be related to the environment. We thought that transportation vehicles are one of the most damaging factors for environmental pollution, and in accordance with the purpose of our project, which we learned in the lesson, we found it appropriate to prepare a database on environmental transportation vehicles. 
Afterwards, we had a long discussion on how to develop our project and started doing literature research. We have identified many entities based on our research. So we started drawing the diagram. Subsequently, we finished the diagram and together we finalized our report.
1.	It is decided which field the subject will be related to
2.	The specific topic is determined
3.	Literature research is done
4.	Entities are identified
5.	The diagram is drawn
6.	The report is finalized
